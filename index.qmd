## Abstract

Add project abstract here.

This project focuses on compiling and analyzing statistical data for a diverse range of 278 crop and livestock products. The dataset will be expressed in key indicators like production quantities, yields, and processed product outputs, making it a valuable resource for understanding global agricultural production patterns across crops and livestock industries.

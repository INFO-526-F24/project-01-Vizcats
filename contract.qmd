Project Overview

Project Description: This project focuses on compiling and analyzing statistical data for a diverse range of 278 crop and livestock products. The dataset will be expressed in key indicators like production quantities, yields, and processed product outputs, making it a valuable resource for understanding global agricultural production patterns across crops and livestock industries.

Expected Deliverables: The project deliverables include visualizations such as a choropleth map, bar charts of the top 10 rice producers, a pie chart of regional production shares, and a line chart of global trends. An interactive dashboard will enable data exploration at global and country levels. A comprehensive data analysis report, along with a presentation deck and infographics summarizing key insights, will be provided. The cleaned dataset and metadata documentation will also be included.

Team Goals
